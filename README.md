This repository accompanies the paper "Covering the Combinatorial Design Space of Multiplex CRISPR/Cas Experiments in Plants" by Kirsten Van Huffel, Michiel Stock, Thomas Jacobs, Tom Ruttink and Bernard De Baets.

It provides simulation- and BioCCP-based approaches for calculating the plant library size for full combinatorial coverage of multiplex CRISPR/Cas experiments in plants.

All functions can be found in the file `MultiplexCrisprDOE.jl`.

The graphs and results from our work can be regenerated by running the Jupyter notebooks. Values of design parameters can be adjusted according for researchers wanting to do computations for specific of multiplex CRISPR/Cas experiments.
